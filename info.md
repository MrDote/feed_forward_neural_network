# Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN)

Eg. for classification we want to separate out the classes by drawing a decision boundary
Input data (as given) is not linearly separable.
By performing non-linear transformation of layer's inputs able to project data from one vector space to another -> draw a complex decision boundary to separate classes (similar to SVMs)



# Miscellaneous

## Animating graphs

- Define the items of graph, which will remain constant
